/// Accelerates a search for a given sequence of elements within a 
/// collection.
///
/// Given an array representing a sequence of elements to search for, 
/// the initializer computes a table of offsets for each of the elements. 
/// Calling `skipIndex(in:)` with a collection will then return the index 
/// of the first *possible* match for that sequence of elements. By 
/// using the table of offsets, it avoids repeatedly testing the equality 
/// of every single element.
/// 
/// This type currently implements a version of the
/// [Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer-Moore-Horspool_algorithm) 
/// adapted to work with Swift `Collection`. It uses a `Dictionary` 
/// as a sparse array to store the offsets, so its performance may vary 
/// slightly from textbook implementations. This is especially true if the 
/// collection being matched against is not a `RandomAccessCollection` 
/// or enumerating its indices is not an O(1) operation.
/// 
/// - Complexity: O(m) space, where m = size of needle.
