/// Conforming types describe patterns of elements in a collection. 
/// 
/// A pattern can be matched against a collection to find a slice of 
/// the collection with the structure described by that pattern. For 
/// instance, the following pattern describes either of the strings 
/// `"hi"` or `"hello"`:
/// 
///     let greeting = String.pattern("hi"/ | "hello"/)
/// 
/// You can find matches in a string using the `matches(with:)` 
/// method on `Collection`:
/// 
///     for match in myText.matches(with: greeting) {
///         print(match.contents)
///     }
/// 
/// Although these examples show patterns of characters in strings, 
/// patterns can be used with any `Collection` of `Hashable` elements. 
/// This code matches a poor luggage combination:
/// 
///     if numbers.contains([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]/) {
///         print("That's the stupidest combination I've ever heard in my life!")
///     }
/// 
/// Patterns support most of the basic capabilites of a regular 
/// expression, including concatenation, alternation, and greedy 
/// quantifiers. They can also be extended to support new types of 
/// matches.
